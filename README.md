# üè• Nursing Assistant Autonomous Robot System  

## 1. üìå Project Overview

To address the excessive workload and burnout of nurses in hospital settings, we developed an autonomous robotic system that automates **medication delivery** and **vital sign monitoring**.

The system consists of **two TurtleBot4 robots** working cooperatively to perform logistics and patient interaction tasks across the **pharmacy and ward areas** in a hospital-like environment.

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Features and Functionalities

### ‚úÖ Autonomous Navigation & Obstacle Avoidance
- SLAM-based navigation using ROS 2 Nav2
- Robust operation in complex environments like hospital corridors and rooms
- Dynamic obstacle detection (e.g. humans) with auto-stop and resume

### ‚úÖ Object and Patient Detection
- Real-time detection of medical items (Tylenol, bandages, etc.) using YOLOv8 and YOLOv11
- Patient identification using ArUco markers and face detection
- 3D localization via depth-based position estimation and TF2 transforms

### ‚úÖ Contactless Vital Sign Monitoring
- rPPG-based estimation of heart rate, SpO2, and blood pressure
- Integrated with face tracking and signal enhancement filters

### ‚úÖ Cloud-Based Robot Communication
- MQTT messaging over EMQX Cloud for stable multi-robot coordination
- Decentralized task assignment and rendezvous point logic

### ‚úÖ Integrated GUI Control Panel
- Real-time logistics requests and monitoring
- Visual display of robot status, positions, and vital signs
