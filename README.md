# üè• Nursing Assistant Autonomous Robot System  

## 1. üìå Project Overview

To address the excessive workload and burnout of nurses in hospital settings, we developed an autonomous robotic system that automates **medication delivery** and **vital sign monitoring**.

The system consists of **two TurtleBot4 robots** working cooperatively to perform logistics and patient interaction tasks across the **pharmacy and ward areas** in a hospital-like environment.
